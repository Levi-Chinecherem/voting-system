            <h2>Welcome to School Voting System</h2>
            <p>
                School Voting System is an automated platform where students and staff can participate in voting for their preferred candidates.
                The system ensures a fair and transparent voting process.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Voting Period:</h4>
            <p>
                The voting period for each position is specified in the system. Users can only vote during the active voting
                period for each position. Once the voting period for a position ends, voting for that position will be closed.
            </p>

            <p>
                To start voting, please log in using your registered account or register for a new account if you haven't already.
